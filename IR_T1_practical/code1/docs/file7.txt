When Zika virus started it was all over the news.  What happened? Is there now a vaccine? Should we be worried about Zika virus coming back? I would like to know where the US is in terms of controlling the Zika virus, and what is the threat today.  The effects of Zika such as causing deformities in children are not relevant.  I'm more interested in what research is being done and is there still a threat in the US. Can my dogs contract Zika?
