A friend is an identical twin. Her sister is already showing signs of dementia at 65.
Now her twin is concerned she too will experience early onslaught of the disease.
I would like to know more about the disease focused on females.
Are there things we can do to lessen our chances of getting the disease?
Is the disease always identified by genetic testing?
