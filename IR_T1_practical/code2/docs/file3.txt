COVID-19 variants appear to transmit faster and are fueling outbreaks from the U.K. to South Africa. The U.K. variant of the COVID-19 virus, which contains 17 mutations, appears to be a more highly transmissible form of the virus and is showing up in at least 19 countries around the world.  The South Africa variant is being seen in 4 other countries. Both variants seem to be more contagious but there is no evidence that they cause more severe illness.
