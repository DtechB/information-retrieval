The Hubble space telescope was launched in 1990 and is providing the world with dazzling images of the universe as well as creating breakthroughs in astrophysics.  It is nearing the end of its usable life and is set to be replaced by the James Webb space telescope, which is bigger and will be located in a darker part of space than Hubble, enabling it to capture images of the faintest galaxies.  It will also be able to observe the universe in infrared wavelengths of light, which the Hubble can't.
