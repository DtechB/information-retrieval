I am planning to travel to Ireland and want to understand the impact of Brexit on Ireland, including the impact on currency exchange and imports and exports.  I am also interested in Irish perceptions of Brexit and supposed impacts, whether they are real or not.  What is transpiring in Ireland due to Brexit?  I'm not interested in the politics of Britain in the sense of how they got to Brexit.
