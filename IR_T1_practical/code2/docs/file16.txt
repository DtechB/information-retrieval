A current issue with US military recruitment is the 2016 suspension of the Military Accessions Vital to the National Interest (MAVNI), a recruitment program for non-permanent residents with high-demand skills from medicine to languages. Critics state that America has not kept its promise of service in exchange for US citizenship and that scrutiny of immigrants' background checks are unfairly keeping them from serving. As more women enlist, their roles in the US military are ever evolving as policies change allowing them to serve in combat roles.  A loss of trade-related jobs is increasing the number of applicants for US military recruiters.
