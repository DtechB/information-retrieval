The Trump administration proposed an update to the Endangered Species Act.  Did this proposal occur, and were there any known negative impacts from the new guidelines?   What is being done to hold countries accountable when they endanger wildlife?  I would like to know more  about the impact of changing the Endangered Species Act.  I'm not interested in the politics, just the impact.  I also would like to know more about any international organizations that address endangered species.
