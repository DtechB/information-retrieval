Granting retail stores like Walmart, Target, and Safeway bank charters will help the 10 million underbanked Americans unable to afford the costs associated with traditional banks. Studies indicate that the unbanked depend on lower fees offered by prepaid debit cards and/or money orders to pay bills or cash checks instead of the using payday loans or cash checking services. Eliminating some government regulations and having more retail stores offer prepaid debit cards such as Walmart's successful Bluebird American Express card which does not require credit checks will help the underbanked better manage their finances.
